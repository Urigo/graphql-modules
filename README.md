**GraphQL Modules** is a toolset of libraries and guidelines dedicated to **create reusable, maintainable, testable and extendable modules** out of your GraphQL server.

- [Website](https://graphql-modules.com)
- [Documentation](https://graphql-modules.com/docs)

## Highlights

- **Reusable modules** - Modules are defined by their GraphQL schema (Schema first design). They can be shared between apps.
- **Scalable structure** - Manage multiple teams and features, multiple micro-services and servers.
- **Gradual growth** - A clear, gradual path from a very simple and fast, single-file modules, to scalable multi-file, multi-teams, multi-repo, multi-server modules.
- **Testable** - A rich toolset around testing, mocking and separation.
