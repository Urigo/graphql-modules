We created this guide to make it simpler to add authentication and authorization to your app.

First, let's understand what are we trying to achieve and the differences between authentication and authorization.

#### Authentication

Authentication is the process of ascertaining that somebody really is who he claims to be.

Or event simpler - authentication addresses the following questions:

- does the username and password match?
- who is the actual user behind a specific username and password?
- does the authentication token is valid and not expired?
- who is the actual user behind a specific authentication token?

#### Authorization

Authorization refers to rules that determine who is allowed to do what.

Or event simpler - authentication addresses the following questions:

- does a specific user allowed to do a specific actions?
- does a specific user has access to read/get a specific resource?
