You can transfer files between the client and the server using GraphQL. It is really simple as in REST.
If you're using `express-graphql` as your GraphQL Server, you should install the **[graphql-upload](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-upload)** package and add some code.

## Adding the upload feature to our GraphQL server

You should extend your existing server to handle file uploads.
Check the following recipes for GraphQL Express and Apollo Server.

### Adding the GraphQL upload middleware to GraphQL Express

Let's assume we have something like the following at the beginning.
As you can seem we add the `graphqlUploadExpress` middleware into `/graphql` route to handle file uploads and pass data through the resolvers.

```typescript
import { GraphQLModule } from '@graphql-modules/core';
import * as express from 'express';
import * as graphqlHTTP from 'express-graphql';

const { schema } = new GraphQLModule({
  /*...*/
});

const app = express();

app.use(
  '/graphql',
  graphqlUploadExpress({ maxFileSize: 10000000, maxFiles: 10 }),
  graphqlHTTP({ schema, graphiql: true })
);

app.listen(4000);
```

### Enabling uploads in Apollo-Server

If you are using apollo-server, you don't have to add the express middleware.
You just need to add the `uploads` field to your Apollo Server configuration:

```typescript
import { GraphQLModule } from '@graphql-modules/core';
import { ApolloServer } from 'apollo-server';

const AppModule = new GraphQLModule({
  /*...*/
});

const server = new ApolloServer({
  modules: [AppModule],
  context: session => session,
  uploads: {
    maxFileSize: 10000000, // 10 MB
    maxFiles: 20
  }
});

server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€  Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```

> You can read more about upload options in **[graphql-upload](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-upload#type-uploadoptions)** docs.

## Adding `Upload` scalar into the schema

**[graphql-upload](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-upload)** provides you the necessary scalar implementation, so you should simply put it inside your resolvers.

In the example, we create a new module called `UploadModule` and put everything related to file uploads in it.

`upload.module.ts`

```typescript
import { GraphQLModule } from '@graphql-modules/core';
import gql from 'graphql-tag';
import { GraphQLUpload } from 'graphql-upload';

export const UploadModule = new GraphQLModule({
  typeDefs: gql`
    scalar Upload
  `,
  resolvers: {
    Upload: GraphQLUpload
  }
});
```

## Using it on other modules

Let's assume we have `ImageModule` and we want to add a mutation to it for uploading an image to our server:

```typescript
import { GraphQLModule } from '@graphql-modules/core';
import gql from 'graphql-tag';
import { UploadModule } from '../upload.module';

export const ImageModule = new GraphQLModule({
  imports: [
    // We should import UploadModule for file-upload-related schema elements
    UploadModule
    // some other imports
  ],
  typeDefs: gql`
    type Image {
      id: ID
      name: String
      url: String
    }
    type Mutation {
      uploadImage(name: String!, file: Upload!): Boolean
    }
  `,
  resolvers: {
    Mutation: {
      uploadImage: async (root, { name, file }) => {
        const { filename, mimetype, createReadStream } = await file;
        const stream = createReadStream();
        // Promisify the stream and store the file, then ...
        return true;
      }
    }
  }
});
```
