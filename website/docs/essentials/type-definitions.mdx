GraphQL Schema is built out of `type`s, `enum`s, `interface`s and so on. Defining or extending them in GraphQL Modules is fairly simple.

Just like GraphQL Schema, GraphQL Modules follow the same rules of writing SDL (Schema Definition Language), a single definition per type and multiple extensions. This way we force a good pattern and clarify ownership of each type.

To get started with type definitions in your module, make sure to use `gql` (you can import it from `graphql-modules`) or `parse` (from `graphql`) to convert your string SDL definition into a `DocumentNode` object.

```ts
import { createModule, gql } from 'graphql-modules'

export const myModule = createModule({
  id: 'my-module',
  dirname: __dirname,
  typeDefs: gql`
    type Query {
      user(id: ID!): User
    }

    type User {
      id: ID!
      username: String!
    }
  `
})
```

> Using `string`s could be possible, but we decided to force a better pattern. Using `gql` tag means your IDE can highlight the GraphQL SDL and in general works better with other tools from the GraphQL ecosystem.

> TIP: `typeDefs` can be single item, or an array of multiple.

## Storing SDL in `.graphql` files

If you wish to write your GraphQL SDL in a `.graphql` file, you need to make sure you are able to load it correctly in a NodeJS environment.

To do so, use [`graphql-import-node`](https://github.com/ardatan/graphql-import-node) to make this process easier:

Start by installing it, and follow the installation instructions, based on your environment and your setup.

Now, store your SDL in a `.graphql` file(s), and load it this way, with `import` or `require`:

```ts
import MyQueryType from './query.type.graphql'
import { createModule } from 'graphql-modules'

export const myModule = createModule({
  id: 'my-module',
  dirname: __dirname,
  typeDefs: [MyQueryType]
})
```

## Dynamically Load SDL files

If you have too many SDL files, and you wish to load it dynamically, you can use loaders from `@graphql-tools/load-files`!

Start by installing this package:

<PackageInstall packages="@graphql-tools/load-files" />

Next, use it to load your files dynamically:

```ts
import MyQueryType from './query.type.graphql'
import { createModule } from 'graphql-modules'
import { loadFilesSync } from '@graphql-tools/load-files'

export const myModule = createModule({
  id: 'my-module',
  dirname: __dirname,
  typeDefs: loadFilesSync(join(__dirname, './typeDefs/*.graphql'))
})
```

> Note: the default implementation of `loadFilesSync` is using `fs` module. If you are using `graphql-import-node`, you can add a 2nd parameter with configuration: `{ useRequire: true }`.
