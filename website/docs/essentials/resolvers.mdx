Let's focus on `resolve` functions usually called just **resolvers**.

With GraphQL-Modules, you implement your resolvers in the same way you do that in any other GraphQL implementation.

Modules created by GraphQL-Modules are smart enough to detect incorrect resolvers (that don't match type definitions or extensions for example). It helps you to detect duplicate and incorrect resolvers, or old resolvers that shouldn't be there.

## Resolvers Example

Let's take for an example the following schema for `User` and `Query`.

```ts
import { createModule, gql } from 'graphql-modules'

export const myModule = createModule({
  id: 'my-module',
  dirname: __dirname,
  typeDefs: gql`
    type Query {
      user(id: ID!): User
    }

    type User {
      id: ID!
      username: String!
    }
  `,
  resolvers: {
    Query: {
      user(root, { id }) {
        return {
          _id: id,
          username: 'jhon'
        }
      }
    },
    User: {
      id(user) {
        return user._id
      },
      username(user) {
        return user.username
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## Dynamically Load resolvers files

If you have many resolvers files in your module, and you wish to load it dynamically, you can use loaders from `@graphql-tools/load-files`!

Start by installing this package:

<PackageInstall packages="@graphql-tools/load-files" />

Next, use it to load your files dynamically:

```ts
import MyQueryType from './query.type.graphql'
import { createModule } from 'graphql-modules'
import { loadFilesSync } from '@graphql-tools/load-files'

export const myModule = createModule({
  id: 'my-module',
  dirname: __dirname,
  typeDefs: loadFilesSync(join(__dirname, './typeDefs/*.graphql')),
  resolvers: loadFilesSync(join(__dirname, './resolvers/*.ts'))
})
```
