# Scopes

Scope defines a life cycle of `Providers` and `InjectionToken`. There are two kinds of scopes, **Singleton** and **Operation**, former is used by default.

## Singleton

As mentioned before, `Singleton` scope is the default choice in GraphQL Modules. Every Service and Token is created even before the first incoming GraphQL operation and never gets destroyed (only when Node process is terminated).

<Callout type="warning">
  We decided to make it the default choice, because of performance-related
  reasons. In most cases, there's no need to instantiate classes on every new
  request and dispose them later on.
</Callout>

<Tabs items={['Service', 'Factory Provider']}>
<Tab>
```ts
import { Injectable, createModule } from 'graphql-modules'

@Injectable()
class Data {}

export const myModule = createModule({
  id: 'my-module',
  providers: [Data]
  // ...
})
```
</Tab>

<Tab>
```ts
import { Injectable, InjectionToken, createModule } from 'graphql-modules'

const Env = new InjectionToken<'production' | 'development'>('environment')

export const myModule = createModule({
  id: 'my-module',
  providers: [
    {
      provide: Env,
      useFactory() {
        return process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
          ? 'production'
          : 'development'
      }
    }
  ]
  // ...
})
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Operation

All classes and values are created within the context of execution, meaning every incoming GraphQL Operation.

<Callout type="warning">
  Because of performance-related reasons, we recommend using Singletons whenever
  possible.
</Callout>

The `Data` class defined below gets instantiated for every new GraphQL operation and disposed once the operation is resolved. Operation Scope doesn't overlap for incoming requests, so for 3 requests at a time, 3 instances of `Data` are created, one per each request.

To improve the performance a bit, GraphQL Modules instantiate services on demand. When `Data` is not called anywhere directly or indirectly by resolvers, the service is not created.

All services and tokens are destroyed right after the GraphQL execution phase.

<Tabs items={['Service', 'Factory Provider']}>
<Tab>

```ts
import { Injectable, Scope, createModule } from 'graphql-modules'

@Injectable({
  scope: Scope.Operation // <- here
})
class Data {}

export const myModule = createModule({
  id: 'my-module',
  providers: [Data]
  // ...
})
```

</Tab>

<Tab>
```ts
import {
  Injectable,
  Scope,
  InjectionToken,
  createModule
} from 'graphql-modules'

const Env = new InjectionToken<'production' | 'development'>('environment')

export const myModule = createModule({
  id: 'my-module',
  providers: [
    {
      provide: Env,
      scope: Scope.Operation, // <- here
      useFactory() {
        return process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
          ? 'production'
          : 'development'
      }
    }
  ]
  // ...
})
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Using Both

**Directly** accessing a Singleton service in an Operation scoped service is possible, but not the other way around.

With [`@ExecutionContext`](../advanced/execution-context) decorator, your Singleton services will be able to **indirectly** access Operation scoped Tokens and Services.
