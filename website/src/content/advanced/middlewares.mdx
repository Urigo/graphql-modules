# Middlewares

Middleware is a way to intercept individual resolve functions or a group of them and return a different result or throw an exception based on a condition. Each middleware can access everything that resolves function receives. The ability to access context and the [`Injector`](../di/introduction) makes it even more powerful.

## Middleware function

The middleware function can be `sync` or `async` and accepts two arguments. The first one is an object containing `root`, `args`, `context` and `info` properties, we call it `event`. The other argument is a function that calls the next middleware, called `next`.

### What is the `event` object?

Take a look at the regular resolve function.

```ts
function resolve(root, args, context, info) {
  // ...
}
```

It accepts four arguments and in Middlewares we simply wrap them in an object.

```ts
function middleware({ root, args, context, info }, next) {
  // ...
}
```

Because a middleware function can access `context`, it can also extract the `Injector` and get access to Dependency Injection.

### How to use `next` function?

The second argument of middleware is the `next` function and its only job is to call the middleware or the resolve function itself.

```ts
function middleware({ root, args, context, info }, next) {
  // code

  return next()
}
```

It's important to understand that every middleware should do one of three things:

- throw an exception
- return the result of `next()`
- return a value

In the case where a middleware returns nothing (`undefined`), it's going to be used as the result of a field resolver. So be careful!

## Intercepting results

Middlewares are capable of intercepting the field resolver or even not invoking it at all and resolving a different value.

An example of how to let the field resolver run and intercept its result:

```ts
async function middleware({ root, args, context, info }, next) {
  // code

  const result = await next()

  if (someCondition(result)) {
    return null
  }

  return result
}
```

You can also resolve any value, without calling the field resolve function:

```ts
async function middleware({ root, args, context, info }, next) {
  // code

  return {
    // my result
  }
}
```

## Exceptions

Middlewares behave like regular resolve functions, meaning they can also throw exceptions. It's a useful thing when you need to make sure a field can only be access when the user is logged in or has valid rights.

```ts
async function middleware({ root, args, context, info }, next) {
  if (!context.injector.get(Auth).isLoggedIn()) {
    throw new Error('Not logged in')
  }
  return next()
}
```

## Registering Middlewares

You know how to write middlewares and what they offer, now let's match a middleware with a corresponding type and field.

Three ways of registering middlewares:

- A specific field of a specific type
- All fields of a specific type
- All fields of all types

Here's a first option, intercepting the `Query.me` field resolver:

```ts
{
  "Query": {
    "me": [yourMiddleware]
  }
}
```

To intercept all fields of a specific type use `*` mask:

```ts
{
  "Query": {
    "*": [yourMiddleware]
  }
}
```

To intercept all fields of all possible types, use `*` mask twice:

```ts
{
  "*": {
    "*": [yourMiddleware]
  }
}
```

Now let's understand how to register middlewares in a Module and an Application. Take a look at the following example:

<Tabs items={['Module', 'Application']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```ts
import { createModule } from 'graphql-modules';

const myModule = createModule({
  // ...
  middlewares: {
    Query: {
      me: [myMiddleware]
    }
  }
})
```
</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>
```ts
import { createApplication } from 'graphql-modules';

const application = createApplication({
  // ...
  middlewares: {
    Query: {
      me: [myMiddleware]
    }
  }
})
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Execution order

Without strict rules on the order of execution, you might get unexpected results.

```text
-> Application *.*
  -> Module *.*
    -> Application Type.*
      -> Module Type.*
        -> Application Type.Field
          -> Module Type.Field
```
